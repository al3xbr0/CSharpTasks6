Tasks for C# course at SPBU, 6th semester.

## [Task 1](https://github.com/al3xbr0/CSharpTasks6/tree/master/Task1)
Implement an ATM-simulator which finds all combinations of how to exchange some sum of money by given values.

This program is ported from [JavaTasks5/Task1](https://github.com/al3xbr0/JavaTasks5/tree/master/Task1) since the task formulations are identical.
